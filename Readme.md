# `cthyb.jl` Continous time hybridization expansion quantum Monte Carlo in Julia

The continous time hybridization expansion quantum Monte Carlo method [1] is a corner stone algorithm for solving quantum impurity problems.

This repository contains a minimal implementation of the algorithm implemented in the Julia programming language [2]
